"""Core models for actionable signals - the primary product entity.

This module defines the signal-based architecture that transforms content
into actionable business opportunities. Signals replace clusters as the
primary user-facing entity.

Design Principles:
- Signals are business-intent focused, not just topic clusters
- Every signal has a recommended action and generated assets
- Scoring is multi-dimensional: urgency, impact, confidence
- Workflow status enables team collaboration
- Outcome tracking enables learning loops
