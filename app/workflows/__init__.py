"""Workflow orchestration system for automated action execution.

This package provides a complete workflow engine for executing multi-step
automated actions based on actionable signals.

Main components:
- WorkflowOrchestrator: High-level interface for workflow execution
- WorkflowEngine: Core execution engine with state management
- WorkflowRegistry: Catalog of predefined workflows
- WorkflowStepHandlers: Implementation of step logic

Example usage:
    from app.workflows import WorkflowOrchestrator
    from app.core.signal_models import ActionableSignal

    orchestrator = WorkflowOrchestrator()
    execution = await orchestrator.execute_for_signal(signal)
